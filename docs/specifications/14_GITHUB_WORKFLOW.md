### 2. Work Assignment & Team Lead Authority

1. **Manual Assignment Only:** The **Team Lead manually assigns all work** to members and AI assistants.
2. **No Autonomous AI Task Assignment:** AI coding assistants and autonomous agents must **not** autonomously assign, reassign, redistribute, or claim ownership of member tasks.
3. **No Additional Branches:** AI coding assistants and autonomous agents must **not** create additional branches beyond the approved branch hierarchy.
4. **Role of AI Assistants:** All AI coding assistants function strictly as pair-programming and engineering execution aids under the explicit direction, prompt instructions, and approvals of the Team Lead.

### 3. Branching & Merging Strategy (Strict 3-Tier Trunk Hierarchy)

```text
main (stable/approved baseline)
  ↓
dev (central integration branch)
  ↓
feat/m1-cv-metrology
feat/m2-ocr
feat/m3-extraction
feat/m4-rule-engine
feat/m5-evidence
feat/m6-ui (individual member branches)
```

- `main`: **Stable and approved baseline**. Contains the verified codebase, contracts, workspaces, and demo-safe releases. Direct pushes are restricted to approved baseline syncs by the Team Lead.
- `dev`: **Central integration branch**. All feature branches integrate here. Automated CI must pass before merging.
- Feature Branches (`feat/*`): **Individual member branches** developed from `dev`:
  - `feat/m1-cv-metrology`: **Kunal Raj** ([@kunal-raj-dev](https://github.com/kunal-raj-dev)) — CV, Optics & Scale
  - `feat/m2-ocr`: **Parmarth Kumar** ([@parmarth-kumar](https://github.com/parmarth-kumar)) — Multilingual OCR
  - `feat/m3-extraction`: **Harsh Patel** ([@harshpatelcse](https://github.com/harshpatelcse)) — Semantic Extraction & NLP
  - `feat/m4-rule-engine`: **Ambika Bansal** ([@bansalambika12-ship-it](https://github.com/bansalambika12-ship-it)) — Statutory Rule Engine
  - `feat/m5-evidence`: **Shailendra Pratap Singh** ([@shailendrapratap1](https://github.com/shailendrapratap1)) — Backend, Platform & Evidence
  - `feat/m6-ui`: **Urvashi Rajput** ([@rajputurvashi2006-bit](https://github.com/rajputurvashi2006-bit)) — Frontend & HUD
- Hotfix Branches: `hotfix/<issue-name>`.

#### Mandatory Pre-Work Branch Sync Protocol
Before starting **any** new work on any branch, every member must execute:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <member-branch>
git merge origin/main
```

**Development from `dev` Note:**
Because feature branches are developed from `dev`, the Team Lead may also require a feature branch to sync from the latest `dev` before integration work (e.g., `git merge origin/dev`). Always consult the Team Lead for integration sync timing.

#### Critical Git Guardrails
1. **Rebase Approval Required:** Rebase may be used **only when the Team Lead explicitly approves it**. Standard practice is merging `origin/main`.
2. **Never Overwrite Uncommitted Work:** Always verify working tree status before branch operations. Destructive commands (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout -f`, `git clean -fd`) that risk losing uncommitted changes are strictly forbidden.
3. **Never Force-Push:** Never force-push (`git push --force` or `--force-with-lease`) unless the **Team Lead explicitly approves it**. If a push is rejected by the remote, stop and report the issue immediately.
4. **Cross-Boundary Conflict Escalation:** If merge conflicts involve contracts (`backend/contracts/`), system architecture (`03_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`), legal rules (`02_FINAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md`, `16_DECISION_LOG.md`), or another member's code, **STOP immediately and inform the Team Lead**. Do NOT resolve cross-boundary conflicts unilaterally.
5. **No Extra Branches:** Do not create any additional feature branches. Work proceeds strictly on the designated member branches.

### 4. Pull Request (PR) Policy & Code Review Rules

1. Every PR must reference a specific requirements ID (e.g., `FR-03: Implement ArUco Planar Homography` or `FR-21: Web Portal & RBAC`).
2. Every PR must pass all automated CI unit tests and lint checks before submission.
3. Every PR must be reviewed and approved by at least **one other team member** whose interface is affected.
4. **No AGPL-3.0 Dependencies:** Any PR introducing an AGPL-licensed package (e.g., `ultralytics`) will be rejected automatically by CI license scanning.
5. PR merges into `dev` require passing CI and must be approved by the Team Lead. Rebase during merge is permitted only with Team Lead approval.

### 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

A feature is considered **DONE** if and only if:

1. It strictly conforms to the JSON schemas defined in `07_API_AND_INTERFACE_CONTRACTS.md`.
2. It has passing unit/integration tests with $> 85\%$ code coverage for mathematical and rule logic.
3. It executes within the performance budgets specified in `03_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` (server web round-trip $\le 1800\text{ ms}$, local CPU engine $\le 1200\text{ ms}$).
4. It handles network latency, validation errors, and pipeline rejections gracefully without unhandled crashes.
5. It is documented with clear OpenAPI schemas and integration test assertions.
6. It was decomposed into testable chunks before implementation and executed chunk-by-chunk with verification at each step.
7. Its execution is documented in `progress.md` with an official verified signing note (`SIGNED OFF BY: <handle> (<email>) — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST [VERIFIED]`).
